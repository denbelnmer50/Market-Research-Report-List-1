<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Scrubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OpenLoopScrubbers</li><li>ClosedLoopScrubbers</li><li>HybridScrubbers</li><li>MembraneScrubbers</li><li>DryScrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine scrubber market comprises several types designed for reducing sulfur emissions from ships. Open-loop scrubbers use seawater to neutralize exhaust gases, discharging treated water back into the ocean. Closed-loop scrubbers utilize a recirculation system with chemicals to treat exhaust, storing waste for disposal on land. Hybrid scrubbers can operate in both modes. Membrane scrubbers use porous membranes for gas separation, while dry scrubbers employ solid adsorbents to capture pollutants. Each type serves specific regulatory and operational needs.</p></p>
