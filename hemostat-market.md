<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemostat Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Type</li><li>Flowable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hemostat market is primarily divided into two types: mechanical and flowable. Mechanical hemostats, such as clamps, clips, and sutures, physically obstruct blood flow during surgical procedures. They provide immediate control but require careful handling. Flowable hemostats, including gels and powders, are designed to promote coagulation through biochemical means and can be applied directly to bleeding sites, often enhancing the body's natural clotting process. Together, these types cater to various surgical needs, ensuring effective bleeding management.</p></p>
