<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Overload Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Reset Thermal Overload Relays</li><li>Automatic Reset Thermal Overload Relays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thermal overload relays are crucial devices used to protect electric motors from overheating due to excessive current. The market is primarily segmented into two types: manual reset and automatic reset thermal overload relays. Manual reset relays require an operator to reset the device after a trip, ensuring that the fault is addressed before restarting. In contrast, automatic reset relays reset themselves once the motor cools down, providing continuous operation but requiring careful monitoring to prevent recurring faults.</p></p>
