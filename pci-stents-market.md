<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCI Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li><li>Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold (BVS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCI stents market consists of three main types: Bare-metal Stents (BMS), Drug-eluting Stents (DES), and Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS). BMS are made from metal and provide structural support but lack drug delivery, leading to potential restenosis. DES are coated with medications that reduce restenosis risk by releasing drugs over time. BVS are innovative devices designed to dissolve over time, promoting natural vessel healing while providing temporary support. Each type addresses different patient needs in coronary artery interventions.</p></p>
